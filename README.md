# Async Crash Course

This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoRJizFvM7s&list=WL&index=16&t=0s">tutorial</a> I followed covers callbacks, promises and async awaits syntax.  These are ways of dealing with asynchronous data.

With asynchronous JavaScript you are often making requests to servers  and each request may take a couple of seconds and you do not want your program to stall while you are waiting for said data.  

Callbacks were previously used to handle asynchronous data and then promises were introduced in ES6 as a more elegant way to handle asynchronous data.  Async await was introduced with ES7 which still deals with promises but in a different way.
